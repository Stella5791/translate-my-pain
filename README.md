# Explain My Pain 🩺🧠

**Explain My Pain** is a patient-centered web app that uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze metaphorical descriptions of chronic pelvic pain—particularly in endometriosis. It transforms free-text pain descriptions into structured summaries to support doctor–patient communication, clinical understanding, and research into figurative language in healthcare.

---

## 🧩 What It Does

- **Identifies metaphorical language** using a custom taxonomy  
- **Tags metaphors** by type and maps them to experiential and emotional dimensions  
- **Generates outputs** tailored for:  
  - 🫂 **Patients** (“How this might feel to you”)  
  - 🩺 **Doctors** (“Clinical notes”)  
- **Supports structured summaries** ready for printing or discussion

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (Flask)  
- **Regex-based NLP** with a handcrafted metaphor taxonomy  
- **HTML/CSS** (Jinja templates)  
- **JSON-based knowledge base** for metaphor types, entailments, and rephrasings  
- **Print-ready UI** for exporting symptom summaries

## 🧪 Example Use Case

**Input:**

> “When I ovulate, it feels like someone is strangling my womb. During my period, it’s like a fireball tearing through me.”

**Detected Tags:**

- `strangling` → `constriction_pressure`  
- `fireball`, `tearing` → `heat`, `violent_action`

**Output:**

- Natural-language summary for the patient  
- Structured clinical summary for the doctor  
- Experiential entailments (e.g., inflammation, internal pressure)

---

## 🔍 Who Is It For?

- People living with **endometriosis** or **chronic pelvic pain**  
- Clinicians seeking **clearer patient narratives**  
- Researchers exploring **health communication and metaphor**  
- Employers or funders looking for **real-world NLP + digital health projects**
